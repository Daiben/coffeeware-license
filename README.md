# Coffeeware License

### A software license made for programmers

According to the internet:

> ***Programmer:*** a tool which converts caffeine into code

Hence, the coffeeware license had to be released to the public, there you go:

    /* By ihsan kehribar - http://blog.kehribar.me/?p=122
    * —————————————————————————-
    * “THE COFFEEWARE LICENSE” (Revision 1):
    * <ihsan@kehribar.me> wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you
    * can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
    * this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a coffee in return.
    * —————————————————————————-
    */

This repo contains the license in **.md** format and a badge in **.png** format. Feel free to use this license in your own projects and tell others about it.

Cheers!
